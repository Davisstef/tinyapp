# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

## Final Product

This is the Index of all of the user's created URLs. The long URL is a link to the website.

This is where users must log in or follow the link to create an account. Users must log in or sign up with a valid email and password.
!["Login"](#Login.png)

This is where new users must register with a valid email and password to use the Tinyapp.

This is the area where users can create a tiny URL by entering the website name.

This page displays the long URL and the tiny URL. Both the long URL and tiny URL send the user to the website.
